# Hi there, I'm Evan! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a CS student at the University of Waterloo. 

This summer, I'm a software engineering intern helping to build educational tools at [Ivy Global](https://ivyglobal.com/). I'm also a front-end developer at [Loo Labs](https://loolabs.org/), a Waterloo student organization.
